 * Student ID: 13697394
 * Date of submission: 06/09/2019
 * A brief statement on what you could achieve (less than 50 words):
 * I was able to create an interactive menu where the user can choose what he 
 * wants to do with the program. I learnt to play with structure and I  
 * understood better the file processing with how to use it and why.
 *
 * A brief statement on what you could NOT achieve (less than 50 words):
 * I couldn't achieve the all the verification and tests on invalid inputs
 * entered by the user. I wasn't able to use pointers because their functionning
 * is still new for me and they are kind of tricky so i rathered stick to what
 * I know.
